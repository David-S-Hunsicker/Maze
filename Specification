This is where the Maze specification will go.

create a room object with walls(booleans)

generate a maze of rooms

set two rooms as entrance and exit

remove walls from the rooms to make ONE path
	make sure not to remove edge walls

create an iterator(adventurer) to 'walk' through the maze
	north-south-east-west/left-straight-right-back movement loop
