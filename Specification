This is where the Maze specification will go.

create a room object with walls(booleans)

generate a maze of rooms

set two rooms as entrance and exit

remove walls from the rooms to make ONE path
	make sure not to remove edge walls
	put 'path'  rooms into a list
	pick randomly from there, and remove a few more walls, to create additional dead-end paths.
		deadend method will check to see if it's going to break a wall of a room in the solution path, and avoid it.
	
	
	
create an iterator(adventurer) to 'walk' through the maze
	north-south-east-west/left-straight-right-back movement loop
